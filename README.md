This example Nerves application shows how to implement an SNMP agent (server)
using Erlang's built-in SNMP functionality.

SNMP is an lightweight alternative to HTTP-based management for Nerves applications.

To start your Nerves app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create firmware with `mix firmware`
  * Burn to an SD card with `mix firmware.burn`
